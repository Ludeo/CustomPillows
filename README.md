# CustomPillows
A Beat Saber mod that shouldn't exist (but yet it does)

## Installation
1) download the first zip in [Releases](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/CustomPillows/releases)
2) extract the zip into your Beat Saber directory

## Usage
In-game you will see a mod panel on the left hand side which should include a "Custom Pillows" button.
Click it to go into the mod settings.

1) Select an image in the right list and click the arrow pointing to the right to use it on your pillows
2) Do that for any image you would like to add
3) On the right panel select an "constellation" to change the arrangement of the pillows
4) If you are unhappy with how the textures are layed out click the "Shuffle" button on the bottom in the middle panel

## How to add your own images

1) In the "UserData/CustomPillows/Images" folder you will find a "template.png". Load that up in your favorite image editing software
2) Edit your image so that your character roughly fits in the white area
3) Save it as an **png in the same folder as the template**
